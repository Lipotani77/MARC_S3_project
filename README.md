# Rover Run
Project of Data Structure and Algorithmics 2, S3 

## Introduction
In 2028, a solar storm hit MARC (MArs Rover Cartograph) rover. Its programming, guidance and movements systems were affected. The only way to repair MARC is to bring it back to a base station. 

The aim of the project is to use the tools that we learnt during the semester to help MARC retrieving the base station.
