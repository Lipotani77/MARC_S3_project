# Rover Run
Project of Data Structure and Algorithmics 2, S3 

## Introduction
In 2028, a solar storm hit MARC (MArs Rover Cartograph) rover. Its programming, guidance and movements systems were affected. The only way to repair MARC is to bring it back to a base station. 

The aim of this project is to use the tools and techniques learned during the semester to program MARC to navigate autonomously and safely retun to the base station.
